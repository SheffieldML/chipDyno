	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Transcription regulatory networks are composed of protein-DNA interactions 
	between transcription factors and their target genes. A long-term goal in genome biology is to map 
	protein-DNA interaction networks of all regulatory regions in a genome of interest. Both transcription 
	factor -and gene-centered methods can be used to systematically identify such interactions. 
	We use high-throughput yeast one-hybrid assays as a gene-centered method to identify protein-DNA 
	interactions between regulatory sequences (e.g. gene promoters) and transcription factors in the nematode 
	Caenorhabditis elegans. We have already mapped several hundred protein-DNA interactions and analyzed the 
	transcriptional consequences of some by examining differential gene expression of targets in the presence 
	or absence of an upstream regulator. The rapidly increasing amount of protein-DNA interaction data 
	at a genome scale requires a database that facilitates efficient data storage, retrieval and integration.
	DESCRIPTION: Here, we report the implementation of a C. elegans differential gene expression database (EDGEdb). 
	This database enables the storage and retrieval of protein-DNA interactions and other data that relate to 
	differential gene expression. Specifically, EDGEdb contains: i) sequence information of regulatory elements, 
	including gene promoters, ii) sequence information of all 934 predicted transcription factors, 
	their DNA binding domains, and, where available, their dimerization partners and consensus DNA binding sites, 
	iii) protein-DNA interactions between regulatory elements and transcription factors, and iv) 
	expression patterns conferred by regulatory elements, and how such patterns are affected by interacting 
	transcription factors.CONCLUSION:EDGEdb provides a protein-DNA -and protein-protein interaction resource 
	for C. elegans transcription factors and a framework for similar databases for other organisms. The database 
	is available at http://edgedb.umassmed.edu webcite.},
