\section{Brief History of Gaussian Process}
The Gaussian processes is one of the most simple and widely used families of stochastic processes 
for modeling dependent data observed over time, or space, or time and space together. As a general
setting, Gaussian process of many types have been studied and incorporated in research for decades.
%L$\acute{e}$vy process
The Wiener process (e.g. \cite{Papoulis:1991}) (one of the best known L\'{e}vy processes) is a 
particular type of Gaussian process. The story of using Gaussian process is still a long one. 
\cite{Kolmogorov:1941} and \cite{Wiener:1949} used Gaussian process for time series prediction
date backs to the 1940's.
But probably the history of Gaussian process is even older. 
The Brownian motion is a Gaussian process. This is because the distribution of a random vector 
is a linear combination of vector which have a normal distribution (\cite{Castaneda:2012}).
Thorvald N. Thiele was the first to propose the mathematical theory of Brownian motion. He also 
introduce the likelihood function during the period 1860-1870 when he was serving 
as a assistant to professor H. L. d'Arrest at the Copenhagen Observatory, Denmark. 

Since the 1970's Gaussian process have been widely adopted in the field of meteorology and
geostatistics. Around that time Gaussian process regression was named as kriging and 
used by \cite{Matheron:1973} for prediction in geostatistics. \cite{O'Hagan:1978} used 
Gaussian process in the field of statistics for multivariate input regression problem.
For general purpose function approximators \cite{Bishop:1995} used neural networks,
\cite{Neal:1996} showed the link between Gaussian process and neural networks and
in the machine learning context \cite{Williams_and_Rasmussen:1996} first described 
Gaussian process regression. 

Over the last two decades Gaussian process in machine learning has turned to a major interest
and much work has been done. \cite{Rasmussen_and_Williams:2006} perhaps the most widely used and 
cited article on Gaussian process for machine learning and most of the discussed in this chapter 
can be found there in detailed form.

\section{The Regression Problem}
Machine learning problems can be roughly categorized into three basic classes. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Supervised learning: inferring a function from labelled training data
 \item Unsupervised learning: to find hidden structure of unlabelled data 
 \item reinforcement learning: take action by maximizing the cumulative reward. 
\end{enumerate}
\cite{MacKay:2003}, \cite{Bishop:2006} describes the concepts in detail.
Supervised learning may be further sub-categorized in two fundamental tasks: regression and 
classification. Regression problem deals with estimating the relationship among some dependent
variables with some independent variables, whereas classification identifies the desired 
discrete output levels.

Regression is the task of making some prediction of a continuous output variable at a desired
input, based on a training input output data set. The input data can be any type of 
object or real valued features located in $\mathbb{R}^D$ which have some predictability 
for an unobserved location. 

By definition of regression, it is obvious that there will be some inference based on a function
mapping the outputs from a set of given inputs, because by inferring a function we can predict 
the response for a desired input. In the case of Bayesian inference, a prior distribution 
over function is required. Then the model go through some training process and update the prior, 
based on the training data set $\mathcal{D}$ constructed with $N$ input vectors, such as
$\{\textbf{X},\textbf{y}\}$, 
where $\textbf{X}\equiv{\{{\textbf{x}_n}\}_{n=1}^N}$, $ \textbf{x}_n\in\mathbb{R}^D $ 
are the training inputs and 
$\textbf{y}\equiv{\{{y_n}\}_{n=1}^N}$, $ \textbf{y}_i\in\mathbb{R}$
are the training outputs. Now a key question arises, how can we consider a distribution
over an infinite dimensional object as a function?

Although using plain and simple statistics regression
problem can be solved, but to model a more complex and specific learning task with improved
reliability and robustness Gaussian process is a better selection. 
Gaussian process models can be used for regression model having an object featuring 
infinite dimensionality. Even at present Gaussian process have been
advanced beyond the regression model and now using for classification, 
unsupervised learningcite{}, reinforcement learning cite{} and many more. %TODO citation

We assume the outputs considered at the training level may contain some noise and observed
from the underlying mapping function $f(\textbf{x})$. The objective of the regression problem
is to construct $f(\textbf{x})$ from the data $\mathcal{D}$. This task is ill-defined and 
dealing with noisy data leads to an exercise in reasoning under uncertainty. Hence, a single 
estimate of $f(\textbf{x})$ clearly could be misleading, rather a probability distribution over
likely functions could be much more appealing. A regression model based on Gaussian process 
is a fully probabilistic Bayesian model, and definitely will serve for our purpose. In contrast with
other regression models, here we will get the opportunity to choose the best estimate of 
$f(\textbf{x})$. If we consider a probability distribution on functions $p(f)$ as the Bayesian
prior for regression, then from data Bayesian inference can be used to make predictions:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.1}
p(f|\mathcal{D})= \frac{p(\mathcal{D}|f)p(f)}{p(\mathcal{D})} 
\end{equation}


The dynamic activity of transcription factors can be viewed as a regression task.

\section{Gaussian Process definition}
A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a 
joint Gaussian distribution (\cite{Rasmussen_and_Williams:2006}). It is a continuous
stochastic process and defines probability distributions for functions. It can be also viewed
as a random variables indexed by a continuous variable: $ f(\textbf{x})$ chosen from a random
function variables $ \textbf{f} = \{ f_1, f_2, f_3,..., f_N\}$, with corresponding indexed inputs
$ \textbf{X} = \{ \textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2, \textbf{x}_3,..., \textbf{x}_N\}$. In Gaussian processes,
variables from these random functions are normally distributed and as a whole can be represent as a
multivariate Gaussian distribution:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.2}
p(\textbf{f}|\textbf{X})= \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu,\textbf{K}),
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol\mu$ is the mean and $\textbf{K}$ is covariance of Gaussian distribution
$\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu,\textbf{K})$
The Gaussian distribution is over vectors but the Gaussian process is over functions.

We need to define the mean function and covariance function for a Gaussian process prior.
If $f(\textbf{x})$ is a real process, a Gaussian process is completely defined by its mean function
and covariance function given in \ref{eq:2.3} and \ref{eq:2.4} respectively.
Usually the $m(\textbf{x})$  and the covariance function $k(\textbf{x},\textbf{x\textprime})$
are defined as-
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.3}
m(\textbf{x})= \mathbb{E}[f(\textbf{x})],
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.4}
k(\textbf{x},\textbf{x\textprime})= 
\mathbb{E}[(f(\textbf{x})-m(\textbf{x}))(f(\textbf{x}\textprime)-m(\textbf{x}\textprime))],
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{E}$ represents the expected value.
We denote the Gaussian process as-
\begin{equation} \label{eq:GP}
f\left(\textbf{x} \right)\sim \mathcal{GP} \left(m \left(\textbf{x}\right), k \left(\textbf{x},\textbf{x\textprime}\right) \right).
\end{equation}

The covariance matrix $\textbf{K}$ is constructed from the covariance function
$k(\textbf{x},\textbf{x\textprime})$ and 
$\textbf{K}_{ij}=k(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x}_j)$.

\section{GP: Covariances}
For convenience, we often define the mean of the prior of the GP as zero but the
posterior mean of the GP $p(f|\mathcal{D})$ obtained from the GP regression is not a zero
mean process.

Based on our problem we are free to design our covariance function. The mandatory requirement 
of a covariance matrix is symmetric positive semi-definite. So as long as the covariance function
generates symmetric positive semi-definite matrix, we can use that function for a Gaussian process.
Smoothness, periodicity, amplitude, lengthscale etc. are the basic properties while choosing 
a Gaussian process covariance function. It is very crucial to choose a appropriate function
for further Gaussian process Modelling. The main goal of this thesis is to develop a
covariance function able to solve our problem, hopefully more robust and flexible way.
Here first we will discuss about some of the very well known and widely used covariance
functions. The in detail description will be found at \cite{Rasmussen_and_Williams:2006}.


\subsection{Exponentiated Quadratic covariance function}
Exponentiated Quadratic covariance is the most widely used covariance function for Gaussian
process. This is also known as squared exponential (SE) covariance or radial basis function (RBF).
The exponentiated quadratic has become the de-facto default kernel for Gaussian process and
has the following form-
\begin{equation} \label{eq:EQ_cov}
K_{EQ}(r)= a^2 \exp \left(-\frac{r^2}{2l^2}\right)
\end{equation}
where $r=\lVert \textbf{x}-\textbf{x}\textprime \rVert$. 
Here $\lVert \textbf{x}-\textbf{x}\textprime \rVert$ is invariant to translation and rotation.
So, Exponentiated Quadratic covariance is stationary, as well as isotropic.
Here the parameter for output variance $a$ and lengthscale parameter $l$ govern the property of
sample functions and commonly known as hyperparameters. Parameter $a$ determines the typical amplitude, i.e. 
average distance of the function away from the mean. $l$ controls the lengthscale, i.e. the length 
of the wiggles of the function.

	\caption[Exponentiated Quadratic kernel and sample functions]
		{Exponentiated Quadratic kernel and sample functions}
	\label{fig:Exponentiated_Quadratic_covariance}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Exponentiated_Quadratic_covariance}$(a)$ represents the kernel and 
Figure \ref{fig:Exponentiated_Quadratic_covariance}$(b)$ shows random sample 
functions drawn from Gaussian process using Exponentiated Quadratic covariance with different
lengthscale and amplitude hyperparameter. The random function was generated for a given input
range by drawing a sample from the multivariate Gaussian using equation \ref{eq:2.2} with zero mean. 
The smoothness of the sample function depends on the equation \ref{eq:EQ_cov}. Function variable
located closer in the input space are highly correlated, whereas function variable located at distance
are loosely correlated or even uncorrelated. Exponentiated Quadratic covariance might be
too smooth to perform any realistic regression task. Depending on the basic nature of the function
other covariance function could be interesting.

\subsection{Rational Quadratic covariance function}

Rational Quadratic covariance function is equivalent to adding together multiple
exponentiated quadratic covariance function having different lengthscale.
Gaussian process prior kernel function expect smooth function with many lengthscale.
Here the parameter $\alpha$ can control the relative weights for lengthscale variations.
Exponentiated quadratic covariance function can be viewed as a special case of rational quadratic 
covariance function. If $\alpha \to \infty$, then both of the functions become identical.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:RQ_cov}
K_{RQ}(r)= a^2 \left(1+ \frac{r^2}{2 \alpha l^2}\right)^{-\alpha}
\end{equation}
where $r=\lVert \textbf{x}-\textbf{x}\textprime \rVert$. 
Figure \ref{fig:Rational_Quadratic_covariance} (a) shows the kernels and (b) shows
three different random sample functions drawn with different setting of hyperparameters 
$a$ and $l$.

	\caption[Rational Quadratic kernel and random sample functions]

	\label{fig:Rational_Quadratic_covariance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Mat{\'e}rn covariance function}
The Mat{\'e}rn class of covariance function are given by equation \ref{eq:Matern_cov}-
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Matern_cov}
K_{Mat}(r)= a^2\frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2\nu}r}{l}\right)^\nu K_{\nu}
	  \left(\frac{\sqrt{2\nu}r}{l}\right)
\end{equation}
where $a, l, \nu$ are positive hyperparameter, $K_{\nu}$ is a modified Bessel function and
$\Gamma \left(.\right)$ is the Gamma function. Hyperparameter $\nu$ controls the roughness 
of the function and as like Exponentiated quadratic covariance function the parameters
$a$ and $l$ controls the amplitude and lengthscale respectively. Though for $\nu \to \infty$
we can obtain the exponentiated quadratic kernel, but for finite value of $\nu$ the sample 
functions are significantly rough. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		%\includegraphics[width=10cm,keepaspectratio]{diagrams/SE_cov.pdf}
		\includegraphics[width=14cm,keepaspectratio]{diagrams/Mat32_cov.eps}

	\caption[The Mat{\'e}rn32 kernel and random sample functions]
		{The Mat{\'e}rn32 kernel and random sample functions}
	\label{fig:Matern32_covariance}
\end{figure}
The simpler form of Mat{\'e}rn covariance function is obtained when $\nu$ is half integer:
$\nu = p+1/2$, where $p$ is a non-negative integer. The covariance function can be expressed 
as a product of an exponential and a polynomial of order $p$. \cite{Abramowitz:1965} 
derived the general expression as follows-
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MaternGeneral}
K_{\nu=p+1/2}(r)= \exp \left( - \frac{\sqrt{2\nu}r}{l}\right)\frac{\Gamma\left(p+1\right)}{\Gamma\left(2p+1\right)}
		\sum_{i=0}^{p}\frac{\left(p+i\right)!}{i!\left(p-i\right)!}
		\left(\frac{\sqrt{8\nu}r}{l}\right)^{p-i}
\end{equation}
The most interesting cases for machine learning
are $\nu =3/2$ and $\nu=5/2$, for which we get the following equations respectively-
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Matern32}
K_{\nu=3/2}(r)= \left(1+ \frac{\sqrt{3}r}{l} \right)\exp \left( - \frac{\sqrt{3}r}{l} \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Matern52}
K_{\nu=5/2}(r)= \left(1+ \frac{\sqrt{5}r}{l} + \frac{5r^2}{3l^2} \right)
		\exp \left( - \frac{\sqrt{5}r}{l} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process}
The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (\cite{Ornstein_Uhlenbeck:1930}) is a special case of 
Mat{\'e}rn class covariance functions. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process was 
developed as a mathematical model of the velocity of a particle moving with Brownian motion.

Figure\ref{fig:OU_covariance}$(b)$ shows the sample functions form the OU process having the

\section{Gaussian Process Regression}
Gaussian process regression can be done using the marginal and conditional properties of multivariate
Gaussian distribution. Lets consider that we have some observations $\mathbf{f}$ of a function at observation
point $\mathbf{x}$. Now we wish to predict the values of that function at observation points $\mathbf{x_\star}$,
which we are representing by $\mathbf{f_\star}$. Then the joint probability of $\mathbf{f}$ and $\mathbf{f_\star}$
can be obtained from equation \ref{eq:jointPro_f_f*}-

\begin{equation} \label{eq:jointPro_f_f*}
p \left( \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{f} \\\mathbf{f_\star} \end{bmatrix} \right) =
\mathcal{N}\left( \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{f} \\\mathbf{f_\star} \end{bmatrix} \middle|
\mathbf{0}, \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{K_{x,x}} & \mathbf{K_{x,x_\star}} \\
			    \mathbf{K_{x_\star,x}} & \mathbf{K_{x_\star,x_\star}} \end{bmatrix} \right)
\end{equation}

where the covariance matrix $ \mathbf{K_{x,x}}$ has elements derived from the covariance function 
$ k \left(x,x\textprime \right)$, such that the $ \left(i,j \right)^{th}$ element of $ \mathbf{K_{x,x}}$ is
given by $k \left( \mathbf{x} \left[ i\right],\mathbf{x} \left[ i\right] \right) $ 
The conditional property of a multivariate Gaussian is used to perform regression the. The conditional
property is can be represented by the equation \ref{eq:condProMvG}: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:condProMvG}
p \left( \mathbf{f} \middle| \mathbf{f_\star} \right) =
\mathcal{N}\left( \mathbf{f_\star} \middle| \mathbf{K_{x_\star,x}}  \mathbf{K^{-1}_{x,x}} \mathbf{f,} \mathbf{K_{x_\star,x_\star}} - 
\mathbf{K_{x_\star,x}} \mathbf{K^{-1}_{x,x}} \mathbf{K_{x,x_\star}}\right)
\end{equation}

In ideal case the observations $\mathbf{f}$ is noise free but in practice it is always corrupted with some noise.
Lets consider $\mathbf{y}$ is the corrupted version of $\mathbf{f}$. If we consider this noise as Gaussian noise
then we can write $p \left( \mathbf{y} \middle| \mathbf{f} \right) = \mathcal{N} \left( \mathbf{y} \middle| \mathbf{f},
\sigma^2 \mathbf{I} \right) $, where $ \sigma^2 $ is the variance of the noise and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity
matrix with appropriate size and marginalise the observation $\mathbf{f}$. Then the joint probability of 
$\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{f_\star}$ can be represented by the equation \ref{eq:jointPro_y_f*}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:jointPro_y_f*}
p \left( \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{y} \\\mathbf{f_\star} \end{bmatrix} \right) =
\mathcal{N}\left( \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{y} \\\mathbf{f_\star} \end{bmatrix} \middle|
\mathbf{0}, \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{K_{x,x}}+ \sigma^2\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{K_{x,x_\star}} \\
			    \mathbf{K_{x_\star,x}} & \mathbf{K_{x_\star,x_\star}} \end{bmatrix} \right)
\end{equation}

Regression with Gaussian process is Bayesian method. From the knowledge of a $prior$ over a function we proceed to a
$posterior$ and this happens in a closed from of equation \ref{eq:condProMvG}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		%\includegraphics[width=10cm,keepaspectratio]{diagrams/SE_cov.pdf}

	\caption[Overall representation of covariances between training and test data]
		{Overall representation of covariances between training and test data}
	\label{fig:Covariances_Structure}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Covariances_Structure} shows the overall covariance structure between some training and test data.
For this example we choose 18 training points and 82 test points. We observed the shaded structure because some of
the training data are closer to some of the test data. Observing this structure we can also figure out the closeness
between training and test data. 

\subsection{Making prediction}
The probability density is represented by functions. Due to consistency this density is known as a process. Also by this
property, any future values of $\mathbf{f_\star}$ which are unobserved can be predicted without affecting $\mathbf{f}$.
To make prediction of the test data we use the conditional distribution. In ideal case the conditional distribution
is $ p\left( \mathbf{f_\star} \middle| \mathbf{f} \right) $ and if we consider the noise then the conditional distribution
will be $ p\left( \mathbf{f_\star} \middle| \mathbf{y} \right) $. Both of the distribution are also Gaussian,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prediction}
  \mathbf{f_\star}  \sim \left( \boldsymbol{\mu}_f, \mathbf{C}_f \right)
\end{equation}

The mean of the conditional distribution of Equation \ref{eq:prediction} is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prediction_mean}
  \boldsymbol{\mu}_f = \mathbf{K_{x,x_\star}^T} \left[ \mathbf{K_{x,x}}+ \sigma^2\mathbf{I} \right]^{-1} \mathbf{y}
\end{equation}

and the covariance of the conditional distribution of Equation \ref{eq:prediction} given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prediction_cov}
  \mathbf{C}_f = \mathbf{K_{x_\star,x_\star}} -
		\mathbf{K_{x,x_\star}^T} \left[ \mathbf{K_{x,x}}+ \sigma^2\mathbf{I} \right]^{-1} \mathbf{K_{x,x_\star}}
\end{equation}

These results can be calculated using block matrix inverse rules. The derivation can found 
in appendix section (Appendix \ref{AppendixA}). Figure \ref{fig:dempGPReg} shows a simple example of regression
using Gaussian process.

	\label{fig:dempGPReg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hyperparameter Learning}
To construct the covariance function
still we need to consider the hyperparameters and optimize those. The most efficient and commonly used 
optimization technique for hyperparameters can be done using maximum likelihood. If we consider all the hyperparameters
$\alpha$, $\sigma^2$ and $l$ in to a vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, then we can use gradient methods to optimize
$p \left(\mathbf{y}\middle|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)$ with respect to $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. The Log
likelihood is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Likelihood}
 p \left(\mathbf{y}\middle|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right) =
    - \frac{D}{2}log2\pi - \frac{1}{2}\times log \left| \mathbf{K_{x,x}} + \sigma^2\mathbf{I}\right|
    - \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{y}^T \left[\mathbf{K_{x,x}} + \sigma^2\mathbf{I} \right]^{-1}\mathbf{y}
\end{equation}

We can have the Log maximum likelihood by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:LML}
 \boldsymbol{\theta}_{max} = argmax \left( p\left(\mathbf{y}\middle|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right) \right)
\end{equation}

\section{Toward the GP model of TFA}
Simo S\"arkk\"a indicated an analogical pathway \footnote{Not published yet, came through some discussions}
to construct a kernel function for Gaussian process from
Markovian assumption based probabilistic approach of \cite{Sanguinetti:2006}.
In the earlier probabilistic approach gene specific TFAs was obtained from-
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tfa_SanG_updateCh4}
  \bold{b}_{n(t+1)} \sim \mathcal{N} (\gamma \bold{b}_{nt} + (1-\gamma)\boldsymbol{\mu},(1-\gamma^2)\bold{\Sigma})
\end{equation}
For a discrete time variable $k$ the above equation can be rewrite as-
\begin{equation}
\textbf{b}_{n(k+1)} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\gamma \textbf{b}_{nk} + (1 - \gamma) \boldsymbol{\mu}, (1 - \gamma^2) \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right),
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\textbf{b}_{n_1} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)
\end{equation}
Let's now form a continuous model which has these same finite-dimensional distributions. 
First construct a one-dimensional process with the property-
\begin{equation}
u_{k+1} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\gamma u_k + \left(1 - \gamma\right) \mu, (1 - \gamma^2)s \right),
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ and $s$ are scalar.

We can now assume that $u_k$'s are actually values $u_{t_k}$ from a continuous process $u(t)$ and  
let's assume that- 
\begin{equation}
t_k = kDt.
\end{equation}

A good candidate for this kind of model is the mean-reverting $Ornstein-Uhlenbeck$ model 
(\cite{Ornstein_Uhlenbeck:1930})-
\begin{equation}
du = -\lambda \left(u - \mu\right) dt + q^{1/2} dB,
\end{equation}
where $B$ is a standard Brownian motion (i.e., Wiener process). 
This equation can now be solved on the time instants $t_k$ and the result is a recursion
\begin{equation}
u(t_k) = a u(t_{k-1}) + b \mu + w_{k-1},
\end{equation}
where $w_{k-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,c)$ with-\\
$a = \exp(-\lambda Dt)$\\~\\
$b = \int_0^Dt \exp(-\lambda (Dt-s)) ds\\
 = 1 - \exp(-\lambda Dt)$\\~\\
$c = \int_0^Dt \exp(-\lambda (Dt-s)) q \exp(-\lambda (Dt-s)) ds \\
= q \int_0^Dt \exp(-2 \lambda (Dt-s)) ds\\
= [q / (2 \lambda)] [1 - \exp(-2 \lambda Dt)]$

That is,
\begin{equation}
u_{k+1} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(a u_k + b \mu, c\right).
\end{equation}

We can now match the coefficients:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:a}
a = \exp(-\lambda Dt) = \gamma
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:b}
b = 1 - \exp(-\lambda Dt) = 1 - \gamma
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:c}
c = (1 - \gamma^2) s = [q / (2 \lambda)] [1 - \exp(-2 \lambda Dt)]
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:a} quite luckily has a nice solution 
$\gamma = \exp(-\lambda Dt)$ and from Equation \ref{eq:c} we will have another solution
$s = q / (2 \lambda)$,
which can be inverted to give
$\lambda = -[1 / Dt] \log \gamma$ and
$q = -[2 s / Dt] \log \gamma$. 

If we arbitrarily fix $Dt = 1$, we get
$\lambda = -\log \gamma$\\
$q = -2 s \log \gamma$.

We can now recall that the (stationary) covariance function of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process we get-

$k_u(t,t')
  = [q / (2 \lambda)] \exp(-\lambda {\left|t-t'\right|})\\
  = s \exp((\log \gamma) {\left|t-t'\right|})\\
  = s \exp({\left|t-t'\right|}(\log \gamma))\\
  = s \exp(\log \gamma^{\left|t-t'\right|})\\
  = s \gamma^{\left|t-t'\right|}$.

When we start from variance $s = q / \left[2 \lambda\right]$, then the process will indeed be stationary 
from the start. Returning to the original vector valued $\textbf{b}$, because the system is separable, we can 
conclude that the implied covariance function is just obtained by formally replacing $s$ with 
$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ everywhere- 
\begin{equation}
\textbf{K}_b(t,t') = \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \boldsymbol{\gamma}^{\left|t-t'\right|}
\end{equation}

Thus is equivalent to considering the vector process of mean-reverting $Ornstein-Uhlenbeck$ model
\begin{equation}
\textbf{db} = -\lambda (\textbf{b} - \boldsymbol{\mu}) \textbf{dt} + Q^{1/2} \textbf{dB}.
\end{equation}
