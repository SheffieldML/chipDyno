For this we used the fact that $v_{k,\ell}$ is only present in the $k$ them of the sum over $i$, the other terms are zero. We then differentiate the quadratic (giving a factor of 2) and finally multiply by the gradient of $-\mathbf{u}_{i}^\top\mathbf{v}_j$ with respect to $v_{k,\ell}$ which is $-u_{i,\ell}$.
