\section{System Biology}
The prime goal of Biology is to get the insight of various principle and detail of biological systems. More than 
six decade ago, Watson and Crick discover the structure of DNA (\cite{Watson:1953}) and radically changed the way of 
study and development of biology and biological systems. They explained the biological phenomena with the help of
molecular basis. This new concept help to explain different aspect of biology like heredity, different disease,
various evolutionary aspects as well as development with more firm theoretical ground. Since then, biology became
a framework of knowledge governed by some basic and fundamental laws of physics.

Due to the enormous advancement of molecular biology, at present we have in-depth knowledge of elementary processes 
like evolution, heredity, disease, development etc. These mechanisms also includes other biological features like 
replication, transcription, translation, and so on. Accomplishment of symbolic DNA sequencing helped to reveal
large number of genes and their transcriptional products. DNA sequences for many organisms like \textit{Mycoplasma,
Plasmodium falciparum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens}
and many more have been fully identified. Due to the advancement of different methods gene expression profile are 
available at the mRNA level. Even measurement of protein level and their different subsequent actions are also making
progress. 

Undoubtedly understanding at the molecular level will accelerate to understand the biological systems but these
knowledge isn't sufficient to understand biological systems as systems. Genes and protein are few components of a 
whole system. It is necessary to understand what constitute the system, but even only this knowledge is not sufficient to
understand the complete system. System biology is a new field of biology to acquire understanding up to system level
of biological system (\cite{Kitano:2000}). 

The extent of the area of system biology is very broad and various technique may be may be required for each individual 
research target. Very often it demands combined effort from multiple discipline research area like molecular biology, 
high-precision measurement technology, mathematics, computer science, control theory and other engineering and 
scientific field. \cite{Kitano:2002} mentioned the main four key areas to carried out the research: $(1)$ genomics
and other molecular biology research, $(2)$ various technology for comprehensive and high-precision measurements,
$(3)$ computational studies, such as bioinformatics, modelling and simulation, software tools, and 
$(4)$ analysis of the dynamics of the systems. This clearly depicts requirement of multi-disciplinary research effort
to get the knowledge of biological systems as systems. The abstract concept of system yet more than a collection 
of multi-disciplinary research components. To obtain the proper insight of system beside the detail description of
the components it is also essential to know what happens during the period or processes when any stimuli and/or 
disruptions take place.

Identification of the system structure is the primary requirement to understand biological system. Some of the key 
structure might be different regulatory relationship of genes and interactions with protein that shows the metabolism
pathway and signal transduction, physical structure of chromatin, cells, organisms and other components. Though it is 
very critical to monitor biological processes in bulk using high-throughput DNA micro-array, real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR), protein chips and other methods thereafter methods to identify genes and metabolism network
have to be established. Once a system structure is established up to a certain degree, it is required to find out
the behaviour. To understand the behaviour properly a number of analysis method can be used. For example, if we want
to know the sensitivity of a specified behaviour against some external perturbations, and its time to return its
normal state since the stimuli take place. This type of analysis provides the system level characteristics as well as
uncover important insights of medical treatments by revealing cell response to certain chemical affinities. 

To apply the knowledge obtained from system structure and behaviour understanding, further research is required to 
control the state of the biological systems. All these phases leads toward the establishment of technologies those
allow us to design biological system which can provide cures for different diseases. Even some futuristic example
could be organ cloning technique for the treatment of diseases what require organ transplants or building 
biological materials for engineering specially robotics having self-sustaining and self-repairing capabilities.

\section{Dynamic Mathematical model: what and why in System biology?}
Any models are abstractions of reality. Models mostly designed to focus of specific aspects of the objects for
certain kind of study. usually other aspects are abstracted away. Biologists almost regularly making use of tangible
'real world' models. Some of them are very simple like molecular ball-and-stick, again some of them are complex
such as animal disease model or model organisms. They also use 'conceptual models'. These conceptual models
usually take the form of verbal descriptions of the system and communicate by diagrams. These diagrams are
usually constructed with a set of components and the ways they interact with each other. While representing 
knowledge of cellular or different other processes, these interaction diagrams, or 'cartoon' models may play a 
central role (\cite{Ingalls:2012}).

\begin{figure}[b]

		\rule{35em}{0.5pt}
	\caption{A ‘cartoon’ model of protein protein interaction. Two different molecular species A and B bind to
		 form a complex molecular. The newly formed complex hinder the rate at which molecules of species 
		 C are transformed to species D.}
	\label{fig:Protein protein interaction}
\end{figure}

A major drawback of these cartoon models is that while considering system behaviour they could be significantly 
ambiguous. It even more, if there is any interaction network related with feedback. Complexity increases even
further when the number of components and their corresponding interactions in the network grows. Sometimes it
become very difficult to get the intuitive understanding of the system behaviour. But a mathematical model or
description of the same model can eliminate uncertainty of the model behaviour. The mathematical model will 
consider the quantitative representation of individual interaction of the cartoon model. 
In Figure \ref{fig:Protein protein interaction} species A and B bind to form a new complex. 
The newly formed complex hinder the rate at which molecules of species C are transformed to species D.
A numerical description of the process is required to quantify the interaction. 
Though for simple cases only equilibrium condition is enough, but in many other cases binding and 
unbinding rates might be also required. The cartoon model or traditional knowledge cannot provide a quantitative
description rather a qualitative explanation of the molecular interaction. But a well studied mechanisms with
sufficient data might be capable to show the quantitative characteristics. The interaction diagram with
related quantitative data can be used to develop a dynamic mathematical model. This kind of model consists
a number of equations that describe the systems behaviour over time. This behaviour is termed as ``system's dynamic 
behaviour''. These models are usually \textit{mechanistic}, as they explain the mechanisms of molecular interaction
with some laws of physics and chemistry as well as mathematics. Any of the part of the mechanistic model actually
represent the real observed system. Any change in the mechanistic model's component will also mimic to the real
system. So, model simulation (\textit{in silico} experiments) can be used to predict system behaviour. Some numerical
software built with different programming language are used for this simulation purposes. 

As mathematical model is a hypothesis, so the outcome or result of the model hypothesis are also hypothesis.
Though the real cellular behaviour definitively cannot predict by simulation, but they can be invaluable for 
further experimental design by showing the promising paths for further investigation, or by showing the 
inconsistencies between the real laboratory observations and our understanding about the model or system.

\section{The Systeome Project}
"Systeome" is an collection of system profile for all genetic variations and environmental stimuli response. 
A system profile consists of a set of information about the properties of the system
including structure, behaviour, analysis of result such as bifurcation diagram or phase portfolio. The structure
of the system should include structure of gene and metabolic networks and its physical structure, associated constants,
and their properties (\cite{Kitano:2002}).

Systeome is not just a simple cascade map rather it assumes different active and dynamic solutions, simulations as
well as profiling of various system status. The Systeome project might be established with dealing all aspects for
profiling the Systeome of yeast, \textit{C. elegans, Drosophila,} mouse and finally human.
The primary goal of the Human Systeome project is defined as-
``To complete a detailed and comprehensive simulation model of the human cell at an estimated error margin of 
20 percent by the year 2020, and to finish identifying the system profile for all genetic variations, 
drug responses, and environmental stimuli by the year 2030''(\cite{Kitano:2002}).

This is a highly ambitious project, and requires several milestones. Some pilot projects will lead toward the final
goal. Initial pilot projects are using yeast for the simplicity of structure and subsequent behaviour.
\textit{C.elegans} have comparatively complex system structure and so is their behaviour. Beside such pilot projects
concurrently the Human Systeome project shall be commenced.

The futuristic impact of this project will be very wide spread as well as far-reaching. These will be the baseline
and standard asset for any further biological research to provide fundamental diagnostics and prediction for a variety
of medical practice. This Systeome project involves many other major engineering projects for developing the 
measurements, as well as software platform.

\section{\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}}
\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} is a nonparasitic, soil dwelling, small nematode worm. \textit{C. elegans} and 
other \textit{Caenorhabditis} species are found through all over the world. It can easily colonize 
mostly in the rotting materials with other microorganism. 
\textit{C. elegans} is easy to maintain in the petri dishes at the laboratory. At $25\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$
\textit{C. elegans} completeits life cycle in just 2.5 days from fertilized embryos to egg-laying 
adult through 4 larval stages. Its typical life span is 2-3 weeks. In 1965, Sydney Brenner 
introduced \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} as a model organism to study the behaviour and development 
of animal (\cite{Brenner:1974}).

\textit{C. elegans} is a relatively new addition as a model organism but its biological characteristics 
and property already been studied to an extraordinary level. The anatomical characteristics and 
detail development of this nematode was facilitated by its simple body plan. Its an eukaryote and
it shares cellular and molecular structures and control pathways with higher organism. \textit{C. elegans}
is multicellular, an adult wild type  consist of 959 somatic cells and among these 302 are neurons
(\cite{Sulston:1977, Palikaras:2013}). Its developmental process like embryogenesis, morphogenesis 
goes through a complex process to growth to an adult. Yet monitoring of the cellular process 
and recording of cell division pattern is comparatively easier as its body is transparent. 
C Elegan's complete cell lineage at the electron microscopy level has been completed. 
Its already been established and this cell lineage is remarkably invariant between animal to
animal (\cite{Brenner:1974, Byerly:1976, Sulston:1980, Wood:1988}).

\end{figure}

To elucidate pathways and processes relevant to human biology 
and disease C. Elegans is using as a vital model. There are between $\sim20,250$ to $\sim21,700$ 
predicted protein-coding genes in \textit{C. elegans} (\cite{Gerstein:2010}).
Using four different orthology-prediction methods \cite{Daniel:2011} assayed four methods 
to compile a list of \textit{C. elegans} orthologs of human genes. 
A  list of 7,663 unique protein-coding genes were resulted in that list and this
represents $\sim38\%$ of the 20,250 protein-coding genes predicted in \textit{C. elegans}. When human genes 
introduced into \textit{C. elegans} human genes replaced their homologs. On the contrary, many \textit{C. elegans}
genes can function with great deal of similarity to human like mammalian genes. So, 
the biological insight acquire from \textit{C. elegans} may be directly applicable to more 
complex organism like human.

\section{Transcription}

All the process in the body take places through some proteins. So, cells needs protein continuously. 
On the consequences, protein are required to be manufactured at every moment in the body. Inside cell 
protein is manufactured from the DNA. When any cells in the body is in need of protein, a special signal 
is sent to the DNA using hormones. Then proteins reside in DNA start to manufacture based on the 
received codes. The way that the enzymes finds the information required for protein construction is 
extremely complicated.

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) transcription is a process that involves the transcribing of 
genetic information from DNA to a complementary RNA (Ribonucleic acid). Protein is produced 
from the copy of DNA by the transcription process. This production of proteins and enzymes 
are controlled by the coding of cellular activity. Even the conversion of DNA to proteins 
is not straight forward. An RNA polymerase read the sequence of DNA, which produce an 
complementary RNA. DNA consists of four nucleotide bases named adenine (A), guanine (G), 
cytosine (C) and thymine (T) that are paired together (A-T and C-G) to give DNA its double 
helical shape. The major steps to the process of DNA transcription are :

\textbf{RNA polymerase binds to DNA:} In order to initiate the DNA transcription RNA polymerase and 
sigma factor form a holoenzyme. Transcription process starts at the promoter region of a 
double-stranded DNA. Sigma factor can recognize the DNA and its promoter region. 

\textbf{Elongation:} A sequence specific DNA binding factors called transcription factors then unwind 
the DNA strand. Elongation of the transcript then continues by the RNA polymerase and a 
sequence of chain is opened up. A messenger RNA (mRNA) is formed when RNA polymerase transcribe 
into a single stranded RNA polymer from a single strand of DNA.

\textbf{Termination:} RNA polymerase moves along the DNA unwinding its double helical form until it 
reaches the terminator sequence. At that point, RNA polymerase detaches from the DNA and 
releases the mRNA polymer. In this way DNA double helix is opened, transcribed and reclosed 
with minimum stress on the DNA molecule. At any certain time many RNA polymerase can transcribe 
a single DNA sequence, which can manufacture a large quantity of protein at once.

\section{Transcription Factor}
A transcription factor is a protein that binds to DNA sequences and controls the flow of genetic 
information coding from DNA to mRNA (\cite{karin:1990, Latchman:1997}). Transcription 
factors can both promote or block the transcription process and act as an activator 
or repressor respectively (\cite{Lee:2000, Nikolov:1997, Roeder:1996}). 
A transcription factors may contain one or more DNA-binding domains. These binding domains 
attach to specific sequences of DNA adjacent to the genes that they regulate. Though 
some other protein such as coactivators, deacetylases, chromatin remodelers, kinases, histone 
acetylases, and methylases also play crucial roles in gene regulation but due to lack 
of DNA-binding domains they are not classified as transcription factors 
(\cite{Mitchell:1989, Ptashne:1997, Brivanlou:2002}). 
Figure \ref{fig:MappingEnvironmentalSignal} describes the mapping (we can also say ``cartoon'' mapping) 
between the environmental signal, transcription factors 
inside the cell, and the gene that they regulate. The environmental signal activates 
specific transcription factor proteins. After the activation the transcription factors 
bind DNA to change the transcription rate (the rate at which mRNA is produced) of 
specific target genes. The mRNA is then translated into protein by the process named translation
(\cite{Alon:2006}). 

\section{Key Research Questions}

Key Research questions:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Can we develop a robust data driven dynamic system for gene specific transcription factor 
 activities using Gaussian process over a mechanistic model?
\item Can we step forward to find out the transcription factor activities from a unicellular 
microorganism to multicellular eukaryote?
\item Is it possible to build some replicate specific robust clusters of the gene expression data for \textit{C. elegans}?
\end{itemize}
