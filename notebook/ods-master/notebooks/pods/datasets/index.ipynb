      "The GPy toolbox provides easy access to various data sets. The data sets are accessed through calls to the `GPy.util.datasets` module. This module contains functions which download and preprocess the data for you, presenting it in a dictionary with a standard format for use in `GPy`. On download you will also be informed of any licensing restrictions and relevant citations for the data. The data is then cached on your local drive. \n",
