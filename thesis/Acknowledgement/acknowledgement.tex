I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my mentor, Prof. Neil D. Lawrence for accepting me as a post graduate research student. Neil initiated me into the discipline of Machine Learning in Computational Biology and continuously taught me the most important scientific skills: showed me the connection between data, model and reality. Few have these skills and I was privileged to learn from a true master. Neil’s contribution to the research in this thesis is fundamental, from the basic idea of covariance function for gene expression time series to little comments that made my work presentable with confidence and clarity.

I wish to thank Prof. Guy J Brown and Prof. Richard H Clayton, the members of my supervisory committee at the University of Sheffield for their advice, valuable times, insightful comments what guided me through all these years. I would like to thank Paul R Heath for his collaboration and valuable suggestions that guided me in a better direction.

I would also like to thank the many people who gave me the support and technical backing so I could focus on my research. I gratefully acknowledge the Ministry of Science and Technology, Bangladesh, for the fellowship awarded to me and Department of Physics, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh for issuing me the study leave. I thank the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield for consistently providing the best and most reliable computer support possible. I thank all the administrative staff at the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience for all their help and support, most importantly providing me the best working environment ever possible where I could enjoy every bit of weather change from rain to sunshine, hail to snow.

Good science is always the joint effort of many people and the research in this thesis is no exception. This thesis could never have happened without my fellow lab-mates with their constructive discussions and spontaneous assistance whenever or wherever I was in need. Alphabetically: Teo de Campos, Mike Croucher, Luisa Cutillo, Zhenwen Dai, Andreas Damianou, Nicolas Durrande, Nicol{\o} Fusi, James Hensman, Javier Gonzalez Hernandez, Alfredo Kalaitzis, Ciira Maina, Jens D Nielson, Mu Niu, Ricardo Andrade Pacheco, Alan Saul, Michael Smith, Alessandra Tosi, Fariba Yousefi, Sura Zaki, Max Zwiessele. My feelings is- this is a family and Neil is our academic Dad. There are simply no words to express my gratitude to them.

I am grateful to my parents, for being such wonderful and supportive. They nurtured my curiosity, creativity and passion for understanding from the earliest age. Abba, thank you for teaching me the value of life and giving me the strength to chase my dreams. I aspire to be like you. You was and will always be my role model though no longer with us. Maa, Words cannot express how grateful I am to you for all of the sacrifices that you’ve made for me. Your blessings was and will be the most valuable asset of my life. You are my very inspiration to excel.  

I thank my brothers, sister, brother-in-laws and sister-in-laws specially Ezabul Hossain and Shamim Reza for caring me so much and for their constant effort to step forward in my life since my childhood to writing up this thesis. Without their love, support and inspiration it would never possible to reach this stage of my life. 

I apologize to my son Adib, who paid the heaviest price for this thesis, during the endless hours I worked away from him. I hope when you will grow up, you will understand and forgive me. I thank my father-in-law and mother-in-law for their countless hours to take care of Adib when he was in Bangladesh without me and meet up his every requirements with the best of love and care. 

My special regards to my teachers because of whose teaching at different levels of education has made it possible for me to see this day. Because of their kindness I feel, was able to reach a stage where I could write this thesis. I like to thank Shamim Kaiser for staying beside me and playing roles of teacher, brother and above all a friend depending on my needs. I would also like to thank all my old friends who do not need to be named to know their importance to me!

I owe my deepest gratitude towards my better half for her eternal support and understanding of my goals and aspirations. Her infallible love and support has always been my strength. Her patience and sacrifice will remain my inspiration throughout my life. Without her help, I would not have been able to complete much of what I have done and become who I am. I am endlessly indebted and it would be ungrateful on my part if I thank Zehan in these few words. \\
