In this chapter we design a covariance function for reconstructing transcription factor activities given gene 
expression profiles and a connectivity matrix (binding data) between genes and transcription factors. 
Our modelling framework builds on ideas of \cite{Sanguinetti:2006} 
who used a linear-Gaussian state-space modelling framework to infer the transcription factor activity 
of a group of genes. 

We note that the linear Gaussian model is equivalent to a Gaussian process with a particular covariance function. 
We therefore build a model directly from the Gaussian process perspective to achieve the same effect. 
We introduce a computational trick, based on  judicious application of singular value decomposition, 
to enable us to efficiently fit the Gaussian process in a reduced 'TF activity' space. 

% Initially to build our model we will use two datasets: the classical yeast cell cycle dataset of 
% \cite{Spellman:1998} and the yeast metabolic cycle dataset of \cite{Tu:2005}. Both of the data 
% sets were used to study the above mentioned models. So, these data will be a source of useful comparisons. 
% In both cases the connectivity data will be Chip data (\cite{Lee:2002}; \cite{Harbison:2004}). 
% Finally we will use the data set of Caenorhabditis elegans (\textit{C. elegans}) to obtain a deeper insight. 
% \textit{C. elegans} was used to build the probabilistic functional gene network Network.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First we load in the classic \cite{Spellman:1998} Yeast Cell Cycle data set. The cdc15 time series data has 
23 time points. We can load this gene expression data in with GPy.

Time series of synchronized yeast cells from the CDC-15 experiment of \cite{Spellman:1998}. 
Two colour spotted cDNA array data set of a series of experiments to identify which genes in Yeast are 
cell cycle regulated.
We can make a simple helper function to plot genes from the data set (which are provided as a pandas array).

Our second data set is from ChiP-chip experiments performed on yeast by \cite{Lee:2002}. 
These give us the binding information between transcription factors and genes. 
In this notebook we are going to try and combine this binding information with 
the gene expression information to infer transcription factor activities.

\section{Model for Transcription Factor Activities}\label{sec:Model_for_TFA}

We are working with $log$ expression levels in a matrix $\mathbf{Y} \in \Re^{n\times T}$ and 
we will assume a linear (additive) model giving the relationship between the expression level 
of the gene and the corresponding transcription factor activity which are unobserved, but we 
represent by a matrix $\mathbf{F} \in \Re^{q\times T}$. Our basic assumption is as follows. 
Transcription factors are in time series, so they are likely to be temporally smooth. 
Further we assume that the transcription factors are potentially correlated with one another 
(to account for transcription factors that operate in unison). 

\textbf{Correlation Between Transcription Factors}:  
If there are $q$ transcription factors then the correlation between different transcription factors is 
encoded in a covariance matrix, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ which is $q\times q$ in dimensionality. 

\textbf{Temporal Smoothness}: 
Further we assume that the log of the transcription factors' activities is temporally smooth, 
and drawn from an underlying Gaussian process with covariance $\mathbf{K}_t$. 

\textbf{Intrinsic Coregionalization Model}: 
We assume that the joint process across all $q$ transcription factor activities and across all time points 
is well represented by an intrinsic model of coregionalization where the covariance is given by the 
Kronecker product of these terms.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:K_intrinsic_coregionalization}
  \mathbf{K}_f = \mathbf{K}_t \otimes \boldsymbol{\Sigma}
\end{equation}

This is known as an intrinsic coregionalization model (\cite{Wackernagel:2003}). 
\cite{Alvarez:2012} presented the machine learning orientated review of these methods. 
The matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is known as the coregionalization matrix. We describe the methodology of desigingin kernel using \emph{coregionalization} at Chapter \ref{ch:Clustering_Gene_Expression_Data} in Section \ref{subSec:Kernel_Design_with_Coregionalization}.

\section{Relation to Gene Expressions}

We now assume that the $j$th gene's expression is given by the product of the transcription factors that bind to 
that gene. Because we are working in log space, that implies a log linear relationship. At the $i$th time point, 
the log of the $j$th gene's expression, $\mathbf{y}_{i,j}$ is linearly related to the log of the transcription 
factor activities at the corresponding time point, $\mathbf{f}_{i, :}$. This relationship is given by the binding 
information from $\mathbf{S}$. We then assume that there is some corrupting Gaussian noise to give us the final 
observation.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:yij}
  \mathbf{y}_{i, j} = \mathbf{S}\mathbf{f}_{:, i} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i
\end{equation}  
where the Gaussian noise is sampled from
\begin{equation} \label{eq:epsi}
  \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})
\end{equation}

\section{Gaussian Process Model of Gene Expression}

We consider a vector operator which takes all the separate time series in $\mathbf{Y}$ and stacks the time series 
to form a new vector $n\times T$ length vector $\mathbf{y}$. A similar operation is applied to form a $q \times T$ 
length vector $\mathbf{f}$. Using Kronecker products we can now represent the relationship between $\mathbf{y}$ and 
$\mathbf{f}$ as follows:  
Standard properties of multivariate Gaussian distributions tell us that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mGPd}
\mathbf{y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{K}),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eq:K}
\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{K}_t \otimes \mathbf{S} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{S}^\top + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}.
\end{equation}
This results in a covariance function that is of size $n$ by $T$ where $n$ is number of genes and $T$ is number of 
time points. However, we can get a drastic reduction in the size of the covariance function by considering 
the singular value decomposition of $\mathbf{S}$. 
The matrix $\mathbf{S}$ is $n$ by $q$ matrix, where $q$ is the number of transcription factors. It contains a 1 
if a given transcription factor binds to a given gene, and zero otherwise. 
The likelihood of a multivariate Gaussian is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Likelihood}
L = -\frac{1}{2} \log |\mathbf{K}| - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{y}^\top \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{y}
\end{equation}

In the worst case, because the vector $\mathbf{y}$ contains $T\times n$ points ($T$ time points for 
each of $n$ genes) we are faced with $O(T^3n^3)$ computational complexity. We are going to use a rotation trick to 
get the likelihood. 

\section{The Main Computational Trick}

\subsection{Rotating the Basis of a Multivariate Gaussian}
For any multivariate Gaussian you can rotate the data set and compute a new rotated covariance which is valid for the 
rotated data set. Mathematically this works by first inserting $\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}^\top$ into the likelihood at 
three points as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:LikelihoodRotation}
  L = -\frac{1}{2} \log |\mathbf{K}\mathbf{R}^\top\mathbf{R}| 
      - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{y}^\top\mathbf{R}^\top\mathbf{R} \mathbf{K}^{-1}\mathbf{R}^\top\mathbf{R} \mathbf{y} 
      + \text{const}
\end{equation}
The rules of determinants and a transformation of the data allows us to rewrite the likelihood as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:LikelihoodRotationRerite}
  L = -\frac{1}{2} \log |\mathbf{R}^\top\mathbf{K}\mathbf{R}| 
      - \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{y}}^\top \left[\mathbf{R}^\top\mathbf{K}\mathbf{R}\right]^{-1}\hat{\mathbf{y}} 
      + \text{const}
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the rotated data: $\hat{\mathbf{y}}=\mathbf{R} \mathbf{y}$. 
Geometrically what this says is that if we want to maintain the same likelihood, then when we rotate our data set by 
$\mathbf{R}$ we need to rotate either side of the covariance matrix by $\mathbf{R}$, which makes perfect sense 
when we recall the properties of the multivariate Gaussian. 

\subsection{A Kronecker Rotation}
In this paper we are using a particular structure of covariance which involves a Kronecker product. 
The rotation we consider will be a Kronecker rotation (\cite{Stegle:2011}). 
We are going to try and take advantage of the fact that the matrix $\mathbf{S}$ is square meaning that 
$\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{S}^\top$ is not full rank (it has rank of most $q$, but is size $n\times n$, and 
we expect number of transcription factors $q$ to be less than number of genes $n$). 

When ranks are involved, it is always a good idea to look at singular value decompositions (SVDs). The SVD of 
$\mathbf{S}$ is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:SVD}
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{Q} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^\top
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{V}^\top \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}$, $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix of positive values, 
$\mathbf{Q}$ is a matrix of size $n\times q$: it matches the dimensionality of $\mathbf{S}$, but we have 
$\mathbf{Q}^\top \mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{I}$. Note that because it is not square, $\mathbf{Q}$ is not in itself a 
rotation matrix. However it could be seen as the first $q$ columns of an $n$ dimensional rotation matrix 
(assuming $n$ is larger than $q$, i.e. there are more genes than transcription factors). 

If we call the $n-q$ missing columns of this rotation matrix $\mathbf{U}$ then we have a valid rotation matrix 
$\mathbf{R}=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{Q}& \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix}$. Although this rotation matrix is only rotating 
across the $n$ dimensions of the genes, not the additional dimensions across time. In other words we are choosing 
$\mathbf{K}_t$ to be unrotated. To represent this properly for our covariance we need to set 
$\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{Q}& \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix}$. This gives us a structure 
that when applied to a covariance of the form $\mathbf{K}_t\otimes \mathbf{K}_n$ it will rotate $\mathbf{K}_n$ 
whilst leaving $\mathbf{K}_t$ untouched.

When we apply this rotation matrix to $\mathbf{K}$ we have to consider two terms, 
the rotation of $\mathbf{K}_t \otimes \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{S}^\top$, 
and the rotation of $\sigma^2 \mathbf{I}$.

Rotating the latter is easy, because it is just the identity multiplied by a scalar so it remains unchanged
\begin{equation} \label{eq:RotatingNoise}
\mathbf{R}^\top\mathbf{I}\sigma^2 \mathbf{R}= \mathbf{I}\sigma^2
\end{equation}
The former is slightly more involved, for that term we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq:svdONK}
\left[\mathbf{I}\otimes \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix}^\top \right]\mathbf{K}_t \otimes 
\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{S}^\top
\left[ \mathbf{I} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix}\right]
=
\mathbf{K}_t \otimes \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix}^\top 
\mathbf{S} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{S}^\top \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Since $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{Q}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{V}^\top$ then we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq:yqprime}
  \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix}^\top \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{S}^\top\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{U}\end{bmatrix} 
    = 
  \begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} &\mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
This prompts us to split our vector $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ into a $q$ dimensional vector $\hat{\mathbf{y}}_u = \mathbf{U}^\top \mathbf{y}$ and 
an $n-q$ dimensional vector $\hat{\mathbf{y}}_q =\mathbf{Q}^\top \mathbf{y}$. The Gaussian likelihood can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:LikelihoodParts}
L = L_u + L_q + \text{const}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lq}
L_q = -\frac{1}{2} \log |\mathbf{K}_t\otimes
	  \boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{V}^\top\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}+\sigma^2\mathbf{I}| 
	- \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{y}}_q^\top \left[\mathbf{K}_t\otimes 
	  \boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{V}^\top\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}+\sigma^2\mathbf{I}\right]^{-1} \hat{\mathbf{y}}_q
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lu}
L_u = -\frac{T(n-q)}{2} \log \sigma^2  -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \hat{\mathbf{y}}_u^\top \hat{\mathbf{y}}_u
\end{equation}
Strictly speaking we should fit these models jointly, but for the purposes of illustration we will firstly use 
a simple procedure. Firstly, we fit the noise variance $\sigma^2$ on $\hat{\mathbf{y}}_u$ alone using $L_u$. 
Once this is done, fix the value of $\sigma^2$ in $L_q$ and optimize with respect to the other parameters.

With the current design the model is switching off the temporal correlation. The next step in the analysis will be to 
reimplement the same model as described by \cite{Sanguinetti:2006} 
and recover their results. That will involve using an Ornstein Uhlenbeck covariance and 
joint maximisation of the likelihood of $L_u$ and $L_q$.

Exponentiated Quadratic kernel is very smooth kernel compared to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck kernel and 
perhaps is not a very good choice for the determination of actual transcription factors activities.
Still it can figure out the basic nature of the activities with over smoothness.
Figure \ref{fig:TFA_with_RBFnWhKernel} shows activities of different transcription factors while
the model was developed considering Exponentiated Quadratic kernel with White kernel in additive form.

Figure \ref{fig:TFA_of_of_ACE2}\footnote{The complete model is still in progress. 
After the final model exact figure might be updated from this one}
shows transcription factor activity of ACE2.
While developing the model we choose Ornstein-Uhlenbeck kernel and White kernel in additive form.
We believe that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck kernel will consider the basic nature of the transcription
factors activity while White kernel will deal the noise associated the collected gene expression
data.

\section{Making prediction}
Using Kronecker product we can rewrite the Equation \ref{eq:mGPd} as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:predicYq}
  \mathbf{y_q}  \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mathbf{0}, 
    \mathbf{K}_{t,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} +
    \sigma^2\mathbf{I}\right)
\end{equation}
Standard properties of multivariate Gaussian distributions tells us can split equation \ref{eq:predicYq} into
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gEp}
  \mathbf{y_q} = \mathbf{g} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{g}$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ are also Gaussian distributions and can be represented by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:g}
  \mathbf{g} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mathbf{0}, 
    \mathbf{K}_{t,t} \otimes 
    \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Epsi}
  \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N} \left(\mathbf{0},\sigma^2\mathbf{I}\right)
\end{equation}
Now we can represent the matrix $\mathbf{F}$ of transcription factor activity as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:F}
  \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{I} \otimes \mathbf{V} \Lambda^{-1} \mathbf{g}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Sigma}
  \boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^T + diag\left(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ is the kappa value from coregionalization matrix.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:predictionF}
  \mathbf{F}  \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mathbf{0},\mathbf{K}_{t,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)
\end{equation}
Now we can find the conditional distribution of $g$ for given $y_q$ by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gGivenYq}
 p\left(\mathbf{g} \middle| \mathbf{y}_q\right) \sim 
    \mathcal{N} \left( \boldsymbol{\mu}_g, \mathbf{C}_g\right)
\end{equation}
with a mean given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prediction_MuG}
  \boldsymbol{\mu}_g = 
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}  \right] 
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I} \right]^{-1}\mathbf{y}_q
\end{equation}
and the covariance given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prediction_Cg}
\boldsymbol{C}_g = 
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t_\star} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}  \right] - \\
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}  
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I} \right]^{-1} 
    \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \right]
\end{equation}

The mean of the conditional distribution of Equation \ref{eq:predicYq} %\ref{eq:predictionTFA} 
is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prediction_MuF}
  \boldsymbol{\mu}_F = 
    \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I} \right]^{-1}\mathbf{y}_q
\end{equation}

and the covariance of the conditional distribution of Equation \ref{eq:predicYq} %\ref{eq:predictionTFA} 
given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:prediction_CF}
  \boldsymbol{C}_F = 
    \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t_\star} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Sigma} -
    \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I} \right]^{-1} 
    \left[ \mathbf{K}_{t_\star,t} \otimes \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right]
\end{equation}
