\section{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Caenorhabditis Elegans, a saprophytic nematode is an inhabitant of soil and leaf-litter and found 
		in most of the parts of the world~\cite{hope}.
	  \item Scientific reports on C. Elegans appeared in the literature for more than 100 years.
	  \item After the genetics paper of Brenner's ~\cite{brenner} C. Elegans emerged 
		as an important experimental model.
	  \item Based on the bioinformatics approach used C. Elegans is 60-80\% homologies with human genes. ~\cite{kaletta}.
	  \item Within a very short period of time (approximately 3days) it allows a large-scale 
		(300+ of offspring) production ~\cite{hope}. 
	  \item In molecular biology and genetics, a transcription factor is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequence.
	  \item Transcription factors control the flow (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA. 
	  \item To develop models of cellular processes quantitative estimation of the regulatory relationship 
		between transcription factors and genes is a basic requirement. 
	  \item Quantitative estimation of cellular processes is difficult for a number of reasons: 
		transcription factors’ expression levels are often low and noisy, and many transcription 
		factors are post- transcriptionally regulated. 
	  \item So, from the expression levels of their target genes it is functional to infer the activity of the transcription factors.

	\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}\label{mehhodology}
To determine the gene specific transcription factor activity of C. Elegans we have followed Sanguinetti's probabilistic
dynamic model ~\cite{sanguinetti:01} for quantitative inference.

Let, Gene expression- $ \bold{Y} \in \mathbb{R} ^ { \bold{N} \times \bold{d} } $  and connectivity matrix- $ \bold{X} \in \mathbb{R} ^ { \bold{N} \times \bold{q} } $ \\

Based on ~\cite{sanguinetti:01} TFAs can be obtained by regressing the gene expressions using the connectivity information, giving the following linear model- \\
	 { \centering   $ \bold{y_{n}} = \bold{B_{n}} \bold{x_{n}} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon_{n}}$ } \\

Here $n = 1, . . . ,N$ indexes the gene, $ \bold{y_{n}} = \bold{Y}(n,:)^T $, $ \bold{x_{n}} = \bold{X}(n,:)^T $ and  $ \boldsymbol{\epsilon_{n}} $ is an error term. The matrix $ \bold{B_{n}} $ has $ d $ rows and $ q $ columns, and models the gene specific TFAs \\~\\
      
Two plausible assumptions for TFA-
\begin{itemize}
\item Firstly, Gene specific TFA $ \bold{b}_{nt} $ at time $ t $ depends solely on the gene specific TFA at time $ (t-1) $. 
\item Secondly, it was assumed that the prior distribution to be a stationary in time. 
\end {itemize}
      
Two limiting case-
\begin{itemize}
\item The first limiting case when all the $ \bold{b}_{nt} $ assumed to be identical, so that- \\
\centering { $ \bold{b}_{n1} \sim \mathcal{N} ( \boldsymbol{\mu},\bold{\Sigma})$ and $ \bold{b}_{n(t+1)} \sim \mathcal{N} ( \bold{b}_{nt},\bold{0})$}
	%\raggedleft
\raggedright
\item Second limiting case was when all the $ \bold{ b_{nt}} $ were assumed to be independent and identically distributed- \\ \centering {$ \bold{b}_{nt} \sim \mathcal{N} ( \boldsymbol{\mu},\bold{\Sigma})$}

\end{itemize}
      
\begin{itemize}
\raggedright
\item  ~\cite{sanguinetti:01}  expected a realistic model of time series data to be somewhere in between this two extremes- \\
\centering {$ \bold{b}_{n(t+1)} \sim \mathcal{N} (\gamma \bold{b}_{nt} + (1-\gamma)\boldsymbol{\mu},(1-\gamma^2)\bold{\Sigma})$ }\\
for $ t= 1, ... , (d-1)$ and $ \bold{b}_{n1} \sim \mathcal{N} ( \boldsymbol{\mu},\bold{\Sigma})$
\raggedright
\\ Where $ \gamma $ is a parameter measuring the degree of temporal continuity of the TFAs \\~\\

\item Likelihood function-\\
\centering 
$p(\bold{Y|B,X})= \displaystyle \prod_{n \mathop = 1}^{N} p(\bold{y_n|B_n,x_n})$

\raggedright
\item TFAs can be estimated a posteriori using Bayes’s Theorem- \\~\\
\centering 
$ p(\bold{b_n|Y})= \frac {p(\bold{Y|b_n})p(\bold{b_n})}{p(\bold{Y})} $

\end{itemize}

	
\section{Data}\label{data}

We have collected the data from three different sources-
	
\paragraph{Expression level:}
The point estimate of the expression label and the uncertainty of the expression level were 
extracted from the micro array data provided by Prof. Andrew Cossins using the tool puma ~\cite{puma}.  

\paragraph{Transcription Factors:}
C.Elegans differential gene expression database (EDGEdb) ~\cite{edgedb:01} is the storage and retrieval 
of protein-DNA interactions. EDGEdb contains the sequence information of C.Elegans's 934 transcription
factor and their DNA binding domains. It also represents the protein-DNA interactions between transcription
and regulatory elements. At the initial point we have considered these 934 transcription factors for 
our experiment. 

\paragraph{Connectivity between Genes and Transcription Factors:}
WormNet ~\cite{wormnet:url} is a modified Bayesian integration based probabilistic functional gene network of C. Elegans.
Here the true functional linkage between genes was measured with its associated log-likelihood score.
WormNet also tried to figure out the known functionality of C.Elegans and the links between 
different types of data from different types of organisms ~\cite{wormnet:01} and ~\cite{wormnet:02}.

Evidence code of ~\cite{wormnet:url} represent 21 different types of relations between genes.
Initially among these relations we choose the following four relations to get the connectivity 
between genes and transcription factors-
\begin{enumerate}
	  \item High-throughput yeast 2-hybrid assays among worm genes (CE-YH)
	  \item Co-expression among worm genes (CE-CX)
	  \item High-throughput yeast 2-hybrid assays among human genes (HS-YH) 
	  \item Literature curated human protein physical interactions (HS-LC) 
\end{enumerate}
This relation leads to create a binary matrix of 0's and 1's. If there is any
evidence of connectivity between any gene to a given transcription factor, then the connectivity matrix
is indicated by 1. Otherwise, the value is 0. (Still we need to know about the exact relation).

\section{Results}\label{results}
Table \ref{table:gene_regulation} on page \pageref{table:gene_regulation} describe some evidence of genes regulated 
by multiple transcription factors. Gene C44B12.5 is regulated by transcription factor Y116A8C.35 and 
F33A8.3 while gene Y105E8B.3 is regulated by T20B12.8, F33A8.3, Y116A8C.35, F11A10.2 and C16A3.7. 
In some cases, the error margin is quite high but for some case it is considerably low. 
This is a random example, if we are interested about any particular gene then 
it could be possible to find their regulators and corresponding activity.

Figure~\ref{fig:T20B12.8} shows the transcription factor activity of T20B12.8 on 
F35G2.1, F10E9.4, T26E4.2, C50D2.5, K03A11.5 and T07D1.2. For this experiment the connectivity 
between genes and transcription factors were obtained from 
high-throughput yeast 2-hybrid assays among worm genes ~\cite{wormnet:url}. Here we have only 3 time 
points 3 hour, 24 hour and 72 hour and the experiments were done at $5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. 
All the experiments were replicated 3 times with the same environmental conditions.
The line graph shows the transcription factor activity with is associated error bars.

      
Figure ~\ref{fig:F55D12.4} shows the transcription factor activity of F55D12.4 on F46A8.7
F55C9.11, R13A1.1, F10G8.6, Y106G6H.5 and Y71H2AM.5. Here the connectivity between genes
and transcription factors were obtained from literature curated human protein 
physical interactions ~\cite{wormnet:url}. Here the experimental time points are 
3 hour, 24 hour and 72 hour, and the experiments were done at $5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.



\section{Key Questions}\label{conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Is there any specific gene (or set of genes) which dynamic TFA could be interesting?
	\item Are we interested to figure out the regulators activity for a certain gene?
	\item Is there any specific transcription factor which activity could be appealing?
	\item Which relation of ~\cite{wormnet:url} is the right one to obtain the connectivity
	      between genes and transcription factors?
	\item We have only considered the common data from ~\cite{wormnet:url}, ~\cite{edgedb:01} 
	      and given data (from Andrew Cossins's lab). Is it OK? 
	\item For annotation and mapping between genes ID and ORF we have used ~\cite{celegans:db}.
	      Is it OK?
\end{itemize}	      
      
      

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

We have built a R based tool using the probabilistic approach of ~\cite{sanguinetti:01}. Using our  
newly developed 'chipDynoR' tool we have tried to analyze the gene specific dynamic transcription 
factor activity of C.Elegans. Still we are looking for expert comments, which might be helpful
to conclude our findings.
