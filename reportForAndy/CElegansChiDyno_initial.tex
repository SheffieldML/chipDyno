\section{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}

	  \item In molecular biology and genetics, a transcription factor is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequence.
	  \item Transcription factors control the flow (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA. 
	  \item To develop models of cellular processes quantitative estimation of the regulatory relationship between transcription factors and genes is a basic requirement. 
	  \item It is difficult for a number of reasons: transcription factorsâ€™ expression levels are often low and noisy, and many transcription factors are post- transcriptionally regulated. 
	  \item So, from the expression levels of their target genes it is functional to infer the activity of the transcription factors.

	\end{itemize}

\section{Previous work}\label{previous work}
A much longer \LaTeXe{} example was written by Gil~\cite{Gil:02}.
A much smaller \LaTeXe{} example is using by by Arif~\cite{Arif:01}.

	
\paragraph{Outline}
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.
